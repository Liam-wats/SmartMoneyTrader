Based on the technical requirements and performance goals of your trading appâ€”especially around real-time trade execution, Smart Money Concept logic, multi-timeframe analysis, machine learning, and integration with Derivâ€™s WebSocket APIâ€”it is strongly recommended that you migrate from your current tech stack to a more optimized architecture built around Python, FastAPI, and React.js.
ðŸ”„ Why You Should Switch:

1. Python for Core Trading Logic & Machine Learning

    Industry standard in quantitative trading

    Rich ecosystem for backtesting (Backtrader), technical indicators (TA-Lib), and ML (scikit-learn, PyTorch)

    Seamless integration with WebSockets for Deriv API

2. FastAPI for Backend Services

    Lightning-fast performance with async support (ideal for live data and trading)

    Easy to integrate ML models and database logging

    Production-ready API structure with minimal overhead

3. React.js for Frontend Dashboard

    Ideal for building interactive trading UIs and dynamic charting

    Supports real-time WebSocket connections and modular design

    Easily integrates with TradingView charts, performance graphs, and user journal features

4. Real-Time WebSocket Handling

    Use Pythonâ€™s websockets or websocket-client for stable, secure real-time data feeds and trade execution via Deriv API

    Ensures low-latency communication and seamless demo/live mode switching

5. Professional-Grade Tools & Scalability

    Docker for isolated deployment

    PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing trade logs and user data

    Modular architecture supports future scaling (e.g., multi-user support, mobile dashboard)

ðŸŽ¯ Bottom Line:

To build a reliable, high-performance, and scalable smart money trading system, your current stack lacks the real-time performance, data science capabilities, and broker integration flexibility required. Transitioning to a Python + FastAPI + React.js stack gives you full control over:

    Trade decision logic

    Live broker execution

    Machine learning enhancements

    Custom dashboards and strategy visualization

Switch now to unlock the full potential of your trading system.
