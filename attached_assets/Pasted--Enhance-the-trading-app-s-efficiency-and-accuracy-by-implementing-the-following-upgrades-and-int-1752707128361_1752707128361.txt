    Enhance the trading app‚Äôs efficiency and accuracy by implementing the following upgrades and integration steps:
    üîç 1. Trade Selection Optimization

        Implement a multi-timeframe top-down analysis:

            Start from higher timeframes (4H, 1H) to determine market structure (bullish/bearish).

            Confirm lower timeframe entries (15m, 5m) only in the direction of the higher timeframe bias.

        Use a confluence-based entry system:

            Confirm trades only when 3 or more Smart Money Concept signals align (e.g., Order Block + FVG + BOS).

            Add volume analysis and divergence detection for confirmation.

        Introduce risk-reward filters:

            Only consider trades with a minimum of 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio.

            Dynamically size positions using ATR-based volatility or fixed risk percentage.

        Integrate machine learning for pattern enhancement:

            Train a model on historical SMC-labeled data to recognize high-probability setups.

            Use confidence scoring to filter noisy signals.

    üß™ 2. Connect to Deriv Demo Account for Testing

        Create a Deriv demo account:

        Use Deriv API for connection:

            WebSocket-based API with methods for:

                Real-time market data (ticks)

                Placing trades (buy)

                Managing open positions (sell, balance, portfolio)

            Subscribe to tick feeds and connect your trading logic directly to trade execution

        Backtesting & Paper Trading Mode:

            Build a mode-switch between live demo trades and backtest environment

            Log every trade with timestamp, entry/exit price, SL/TP levels, and trade reason

            Visualize past performance (win rate, drawdown, equity curve)

    üõ†Ô∏è Optional Enhancements

        Add a trade journal dashboard

        Export trades to CSV for performance reviews
